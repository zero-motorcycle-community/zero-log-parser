Little decoder utility to parse Zero Motorcycle main bike board (MBB) and
battery management system (BMS) logs. These may be extracted from the bike
using the Zero mobile app. Once paired over bluetooth, select 'Support' >
'Email bike logs' and send the logs to yourself rather than / in addition to
zero support.

Usage:

  `$ python zero_log_parser.py <*.bin file> [-o output_file]`
